ðŸ“‡ Contact Book â€“ Console Application (.NET)

The Contact Book Console Application is a simple yet powerful project built with C# and .NET, designed to manage personal contacts efficiently through a menu-driven console interface. It allows users to add, view, and search contacts, making it a practical tool to demonstrate core programming skills.

This project emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, clean code structure, and file handling techniques. All contacts are stored in a JSON file, ensuring data persistence between application runs using System.Text.Json for serialization and deserialization.

By focusing on fundamental concepts rather than complex UI or databases, this application serves as a great demonstration of proficiency in C#, console application development, and data management. Itâ€™s well-suited for students and beginners looking to showcase their understanding of structured programming, logical flow, and file I/O operations.
